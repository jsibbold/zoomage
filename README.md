A simple pinch-to-zoom ImageView library for Android with an emphasis
on a smooth and natural feel.



## Gradle
```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.jsibbold:zoomage:1.1.0'
}
```

### For the latest snapshot use
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.jsibbold:zoomage:1.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

# Using It

Simply add a ZoomageView as you would any typical ImageView in Android. The scaleType that you set on your
ZoomageView will determine the starting size and position of your ZoomageView's image. This is the inherited
ImageView.ScaleType from Android. With a ZoomageView, the fitCenter or centerInside scale types usually make
the most sense to use, fitCenter being Android's default scale type.

```xml
    <RelativeLayout
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">
    
        <com.jsibbold.zoomage.ZoomageView
            android:id="@+id/myZoomageView"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:src="@drawable/my_zoomable_image"
            app:zoomage_restrictBounds="false"
            app:zoomage_animateOnReset="true"
            app:zoomage_autoResetMode="UNDER"
            app:zoomage_autoCenter="true"
            app:zoomage_zoomable="true"
            app:zoomage_translatable="true"
            app:zoomage_minScale="0.6"
            app:zoomage_maxScale="8"
            />
    </RelativeLayout>
```

## XML Attributes

```xml
zoomage_restrictBounds="true|false"
```
Restricts the bounds of the image so it does not wander outside the border of the ImageView when it's smaller than the frame size,
and restricts the bounds to stop at the edges of the ImageView when the image is larger than the frame size. Default value is false.

```xml
zoomage_animateOnReset="true|false"
```
Image will animate back to its starting size whenever it is reset if true, and will snap back to its starting size when false.
Default value is true.

```xml
zoomage_autoResetMode="UNDER|OVER|ALWAYS|NEVER"
```
Determines at what times the image will reset to its starting size. Note that UNDER, OVER, and ALWAYS all have the effect of
resetting the image to its starting position if its size has not changed. Default value is UNDER.

```xml
zoomage_autoCenter="true|false"
```
This will cause the image to pull itself into view on-screen if it is partially off-screen. Default value is true.

```xml
zoomage_minScale="{float greater than 0}"
```
The minimum allowed scale for the image. Ideally this should be less than 1, must be greater than 0, and must
be less than maxScale. Default value is 0.6.

```xml
zoomage_maxScale="{float greater than 0}"
```
The maximum allowed scale for the image. Ideally this should be greater than 1, must be greater than 0, and must
be greater than minScale. Default value is 8.

```xml
zoomage_zoomable="true|false"
```
Sets whether zooming is allowed. Default value is true.

```xml
zoomage_translatable="true|false"
```
Sets whether translation is allowed. Default value is true.
